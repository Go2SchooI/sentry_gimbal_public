RoboMaster2023 heu sentry robot gimbal 

I created this repository for the interview. 

This is a project for the embedded system of sentry robot gimbal and it implemented functions including gimbal control, autonomous identification and tracking. The main body of the code is in the Application folder.

Because of the limited preparation time for the competition and the fact that I am not majoring in software engineering, there are many things about this code that are not programmable.
